-- Computes the TVL, lp token total supply and lp token price of a uniswap pool over time
-- Parameters
--  {{token_a}} - either token of the desired uni pool
--  {{token_b}} - other token of the desired uni pool
--  {{start}} - date as of which the analysis should run

-- Given that we might not have records every day in the source data (e.g. not every day the lp supply may change),
