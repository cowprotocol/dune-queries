-- Computes the balances and current value of a counterfactual portfolio that invests 10k evenly into two tokens and re-balances once a day to keep a 50:50 exposure
-- Parameters
--  {{token_a}} - either token of the desired uni pool
--  {{token_b}} - other token of the desired uni pool
--  {{start}} - date as of which the analysis should run

-- Note: not using a simpler recursive approach due to Dune's recursion depth limitation.
-- Current value of initial investment can be computed as the product of cumulative price changes per day, since
-- `value(day+1) = value(day) * (p1.price(day+1)/p1.price(day) + p2.price(day+1) / p2.price(day))/2`
-- Thus, current_value can be computed using cumulative products of (sums of) daily price changes:
-- `(p1.price(day+1)/p1.price(day) + p2.price(day+1)/p2.price(day))/2`
