-- This query is part of a base query for computing CoWs
--
-- Parameters:
--  {{start_time}} - the timestamp for which the analysis should start (inclusively)
--  {{end_time}} - the timestamp for which the analysis should end (exclusively)
--  {{blockchain}} - network to run the analysis on
--
-- The query tags all transfers to and from the settlement contract as one of
-- - user_in: amounts sent by users, tokens flowing into the settlement contract
-- - user_out: amount sent to users, tokens flowing out of the settlement contract
-- - amm_in: tokens flowing into the settlement contract but coming from users
-- - amm_out:tokens flowing out of the settlement contract but not towards users
-- - slippage_in: final imbalance of the settlement contract if that imbalance is positive
-- - slippage_out: final imbalance of the settlement contract of that imbalance is negative
--
-- The classification into user transfers and amm transfers depends on a clear separation of addresses into
-- trader addresses and amm addresses. If an address is used in a trade, all interactions with that address
-- are classified as user transfers, even in other transactions.
--
-- The common edge case of the settlement contract acting as a trader is implicitly handled sa follows:
-- The settlement contract will appear as a trader. There will be a transfer from the settlement contract to itself.
-- The corresponding balance change is accounted for as 'user_in'.
-- This behavior will be wrong when an order is created with receiver set to the settlement contract.
