-- This query computes prices for use in slippage on CoW Protocol
--
-- It gives hourly prices for all tokens transferred to or from the protocol.
--
-- Parameters:
--  {{start_time}} - the timestamp for which the analysis should start (inclusively)
--  {{end_time}} - the timestamp for which the analysis should end (exclusively)
--  {{blockchain}} - network to run the analysis on
--
-- The columns of the result are
-- - hour: hour for which a price is valid
-- - token_address: address of token with a price. contract address for erc20 tokens,
--   0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee for native token
-- - decimals: decimals of the token, can be null
-- - price_unit: USD price of one unit (i.e. pow(10, decimals) atoms) of a token
-- - price_atom: USD price of one atom (i.e. 1. / pow(10, decimals) units) of a token

-- Fetch a list of token addresses and times we need prices for. We use hourly prices only.
