-- This query gives a breakdown of slippage on CoW Protocol
--
-- Parameters:
--  {{start_time}} - the timestamp for which the analysis should start (inclusively)
--  {{end_time}} - the timestamp for which the analysis should end (exclusively)
--  {{blockchain}} - network to run the analysis on
--  {{raw_slippage_table_name}} - raw_slippage_breakdown for a detailed per token breakdown of
--    slippage; raw_slippage_per_transaction for aggregated values per transaction
--
-- The columns of raw_slippage_breakdown are
-- - block_time: time of settlement transaction
-- - tx_hash: settlement transaction hash
-- - token_address: address of token with slippage. contract address for erc20 tokens,
--   0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee for native token
-- - amount: signed value of slippage in atoms of the token; fees are represented as negative
--   integers since they will be removed from imbalances
-- - slippage_type:
--     'raw_imbalance' for imbalance observable on chain,
--     'protocol_fee' for the total protocol fee (including partner fee),
--     'network_fee' for network fees,
--     'settlement_contract_sell' for corrections due to fee withdrawals
-- - price_unit: USD price of one unit (i.e. pow(10, decimals) atoms) of a token
-- - price_atom: USD price of one atom (i.e. 1. / pow(10, decimals) units) of a token
-- - slippage_usd: USD value of slippage
-- - slippage_wei: value of slippage in atoms of native token
--
-- The columns of raw_slippage_per_solver are
-- - block_time: time of settlement transaction
-- - tx_hash: settlement transaction hash
-- - slippage_usd: USD value of slippage
-- - slippage_wei: value of slippage in atoms of native token
