-- In the event that there are any results for this query,
-- "oncall" can manually perform refunds via:
-- https://github.com/cowprotocol/manual-ethflow-refunder
--
-- Parameters:
--  {{start_time}} - the order validity timestamp for which the analysis should start (inclusive)
--  {{end_time}} - the order validity timestamp for which the analysis should end (inclusive)
--  {{grace_period}} - a global shift of start and end time to account for delays in refunds
