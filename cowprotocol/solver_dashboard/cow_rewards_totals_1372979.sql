-- This query computes the total amount of COW distributed as rewards
-- it uses all of the outgoing transactions from the rewards safe
-- and the price is converted to USD using the latest price from the prices.usd_latest table
-- the inception date is defined as 2022-03-01

-- finally the query calculates the daily payout and the project budget for the year
-- the first table addresses contains the parameters for each blockchain: COW token address and rewards safe address
-- To add a new blockchain, add a new row to the addresses table with the correct info
