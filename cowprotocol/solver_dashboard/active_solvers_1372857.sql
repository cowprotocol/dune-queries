-- This query finds all the active (i.e. whitelisted) solvers
-- First we find the latest settlement for each solver
-- Then we fetch the environment and name of the solver for the prod and barn environments
-- Finally we display the name of the solver with both of its addresses
-- Note: if a solver has x barn address and y prod address, we will display x*y rows for that solver
-- Parameters
--  {{blockchain}}: string the blockchain to query
