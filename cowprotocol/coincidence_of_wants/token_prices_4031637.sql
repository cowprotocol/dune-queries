-- This query returns prices for tokens traded via CoW Protocol
--
-- Parameters:
--  {{start_time}} - the timestamp for which the analysis should start (inclusively)
--  {{end_time}} - the timestamp for which the analysis should end (exclusively)
--  {{blockchain}} - network to run the analysis on
--
-- The returned table has columns:
-- - block_time: time of a settlement transaction
-- - tx_hash: settlement transaction hash
-- - token_address: contract address of a token
-- - token_price: price in USD of one _atom_ of a token
--
-- Prices are either fetched from the trades table which contains Dune prices if they exist,
-- or computes them from the exchange rate from the trade if the second traded token has a price on Dune.
-- If no trade with a dune price exists for a token, the price is set to zero.
--
-- Prices are in USD _per atom_ to avoid special casing of trades involving tokens without an entry in erc20 tables.
-- This fits to naturally to other queries using amounts in atoms. If amounts in _units_ of a token are used,
-- prices need to be scaled using decimals of the token.
